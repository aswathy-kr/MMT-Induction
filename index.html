                <p>This website is aimed towards helping really beginners in embarking their path down web development.</p>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Aswathy K Raj and here I intend on sharing how I started my Web Development journey with a glimpse at some of my projects and courses/resources that I took help from during the process and a few tips from my side if you are aiming towards the Web Development domain.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science back in 2012 and immediately landed a job in the Services industry. I had worked as a Technical Support Engineer and later on as a Platform Engineer for a few years. Yet I had this innate desire to try out web development as I was fascinated by the way websites are designed. So I took up a course on Full Stack Web Development which has helped me to make a start in this journey. That was a huge milestone for me as I had no real experience doing web development. </p>
                <h3>Where To Start ?</h3>
                <p>There are A LOT of languages and tools you can use to build for the web. All of them have their benefits, and are maintained by tons of super smart people. While this is great for pushing the web forward, it’s confusing and overwhelming to start.</p>
                <blockquote class="block-quote">Learn HTML, CSS and Javascript exclusively.</blockquote>
                <p>If you know HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a deep level, you will be able to create pretty much anything on the web.</p>
