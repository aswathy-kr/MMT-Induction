                <p>This website is aimed towards helping really beginners in embarking their path down web development.</p>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Aswathy K Raj and here I intend on sharing how I started my Web Development journey with a glimpse at some of my projects and courses/resources that I took help from during the process and a few tips from my side if you are aiming towards the Web Development domain.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science back in 2012 and immediately landed a job in the Services industry. I had worked as a Technical Support Engineer and later on as a Platform Engineer for a few years. Yet I had this innate desire to try out web development as I was fascinated by the way websites are designed. So I took up a course on Full Stack Web Development which has helped me to make a start in this journey. That was a huge milestone for me as I had no real experience doing web development. </p>
                <h3>Where To Start ?</h3>
                <p>There are A LOT of languages and tools you can use to build for the web. All of them have their benefits, and are maintained by tons of super smart people. While this is great for pushing the web forward, it’s confusing and overwhelming to start.</p>
                <blockquote class="block-quote">Learn HTML, CSS and Javascript exclusively.</blockquote>
                <p>While <span class="bold-text">HTML provides the structure</span> for a website and <span class="bold-text">CSS allows you to control the presentation</span> of a site, the <span class="bold-text">JavaScript programming language gives you the tools that you need to alter the behavior of different elements</span> that are found on a website page. If you know HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a deep level, you will be able to create pretty much anything on the web.</p>
                <h3>Tools To Use</h3>
                <p>Next up, download a good software to use as your code editor. Below are a few :
                    <ul class="inner-para">
                        <li class="editor-item"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSCode</a></li>
                        <li class="editor-item"><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom.io</a></li>
                        <li class="editor-item"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="inner-para">
                    After that you’ll need a terminal to run commands and do various other things. MacOs already has a inbuilt <span class="bold-text">Terminal</span> app.  Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal. For Windows users, install Unix-like terminals that execute bash commands.

                <p class="inner-para">Lastly, you need a browser to test your website in, so grab the latest version of Google Chrome.

                <p><span class="bold-text">HTML</span> stands for <span class="bold-text">Hypertext Markup Language</span>. It is a standard markup language for building static web applications and websites. This is a relatively simplistic yet powerful programming language that allows web developers and website owners to create the structure of their websites.</p>

            <article class="content content-border">
                <p><span class="bold-text">CSS</span> stands for <span class="bold-text">Cascading Style Sheets</span>. It is a style sheet language that’s focused almost entirely on improving the presentation of HTML elements. While CSS is a static programming language, it can be used to make your website appear visually pleasing and modern. </p>

                <article class="content content-border">
                    <p><span class="bold-text">Javascript</span> is among the most important programming languages for website owners who want to make their site more interactive, which makes this the most complex of the three standard programming languages. With this tool, you can add a layer of interactivity to the CSS and HTML elements on your website, which is highly recommended if you want your website to appeal to the modern customer. </p>
